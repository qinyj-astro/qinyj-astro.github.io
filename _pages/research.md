## Automated identification of transient host galaxies
Identifying the right host galaxies of supernova (and other transients) in real-time remains a challenge for modern transient surveys. I developed a novel machine learning framework to rank potential host galaxies per their chances of being the right host. The algorithm is trained with transient-host pairs discovered in previous surveys to avoid the implicit biases imposed by other techniques. Our method achieves above 97% accuracy.

## Transient Host Exchange: a database of transient host galaxies
I am leading a team to construct and maintain the largest-ever (~37k events) public dataset of transient host galaxies. The dataset covers a wide range of transient classes (more than 30 subtypes) and host properties (far-ultraviolet to mid-infrared, 21 catalogs). To compile host galaxy properties, I developed a graph theory-inspired, globally calibrated, and locally self-tuned technique to simultaneously cross-match sources in multiple catalogs.

The first public data release (DR1) is available [here](https://zenodo.org/record/5568962). We are currently constructing a website for this dataset.

## Tracing baryonic matter with supernovae
Bright transients, particularly supernovae, are effective tracers of baryonic matter in the universe. I use supernovae to identify extremely faint dwarf galaxies missed by current wide-field surveys; I also use supernovae as tracers of the cosmic large-scale structure.
With images of Pan-STARRS and DESI Legacy Surveys, we identified a sample of 161 “orphan” or “hostless” supernovae – those without detectable host galaxies. Many of their host galaxies are no brighter than 1% the luminosity of the Small Magellanic Cloud.

## Constraining supernova progenitors using host galaxy properties
Except for a few dozen nearby supernovae with pre-explosion HST images, the progenitor stars of supernovae are hard to identify directly. Host galaxy properties, which reflect the stellar population from which supernova arises, are essential and irreplaceable indirect evidence for the progenitors of supernovae.

## N-body dynamics of disk galaxies
Part of my research is concerned with the N-body dynamics of disk galaxies.

In a recent work, we focus on the integral of motion (IoM) in rotating potentials. IoMs are conserved quantities such as energy and angular momentum. The orbital motion stars, if not chaotic, can be fully described in three IoMs; the entire N-body system may also fit in a space parameterized using IoMs – resembling the “Fourier space” of a dynamical system. Despite their vital importance, many IoMs do not have analytical expressions. We identified an effective numerical proxy for the second integral of motion (I2) in rotating barred or ellipsoidal potentials with orbital integration.
