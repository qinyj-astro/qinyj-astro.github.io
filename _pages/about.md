My name is Yu-Jing Qin*. I am an astrophysicist. I study supernova explosions – the spectacular finales of stellar evolution – as well as other energetic and ephemeral phenomena in the universe. My current research focuses on the statistical connections of supernova explosions and the galaxies in which they occur, a promising avenue to elucidate which stars are giving rise to supernova explosions. I also use supernovae as beacons of light to locate extremely faint galaxies, map the galaxies in the universe, and measure the dark energy that accelerates the expansion of the universe.
